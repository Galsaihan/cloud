        Taikhar Rock is located 22 kilometres (14 miles) northeast from
        Tsetserleg, in the village of Ikh Tamir, south the Khoid Tamir River.
        It’s a big 20-metres (66 feet) high granite rock, covered with 150
        writings in many different languages and dating back from many different
        periods (runic, Sogd, Uyghur, Mongolian, Nangiad, Tibetan writings). The
        oldest one is the runic writing, dating back from the turkish period of
        the 6th and 7th centuries. An ovoo was placed at its top. Unfortunately,
        there are many graffiti on this rock and the old writings almost
        disappeared. The government decided to protect the rock in 1994.

        LOCATION: 120 km from Ulgi town of Bayan-Ulgii province There are
        several waterfalls among the outstanding nature of the Turgen Mountains
        in western Mongolia. One of them is Baga Turgen waterfall in Turgen
        gorge near the western shore of the picturesque Khoton and Khurgan
        Lakes. The glacier waterfall falls from 36 m cliff and divided into two
        waterfalls. The bigger waterfall heights 23 m while the smaller one
        falls from 13 m. The pristine Turgen valley is an ideal place for hiking
        and has some historical relicts. The waterfall's isolated location along
        the country border area and rough roads helped its surroundings remain
        wild.

        övkhön Monastery (Mongolian: Төвхөн хийд, Töwhön híd), one of Mongolia's
        oldest Buddhist monasteries, is located on the border of Övörkhangai
        Province and Arkhangai Province in central Mongolia, about 47 km (29 mi)
        southwest of Kharkhorin. Tövkhön Monastery was first established in
        1648, by the 14-year-old Zanabazar, the first Jebtsundamba Khutuktu and
        spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism for the Khalkha in Outer Mongolia.[1]
        He determined that the location on the Shireet Ulaan Uul mountain,
        overlooking a hill at 2,600 meters above sea-level, was an auspicious
        location. The first physical structures were built upon his return from
        studying in Tibet in 1653. Zanabazar, who was a gifted sculptor,
        painter, and musician, used the monastery, originally called Bayasgalant
        Aglag Oron (Happy Secluded Place), as his personal retreat over the
        course of 30 years. While there he created many of his most famous
        works. It was also where he developed the soyombo script.
